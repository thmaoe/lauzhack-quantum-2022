    "The aim of this small problem is to familiarize with quantum circuits and qiskit library and to introduce some basics of quantum mechanics. The main goal here will be to find the decomposition of several gates in the universal quantum gates CNOT, H, S and T gates, and prove through little simulations that your decomposition is the right one."

    "In quantum computing, we manipulate qubits. These are 2-levels quantum systems, it can be a photon polarization, a spin, trapped ions,... The fact that the system is a quantum system allow few very important properties : superpostion, interference and entanglement. A qubit can be $|\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha|0\\rangle+\\beta|1\\rangle$, with $|\\alpha|^2+|\\beta|^2=1$. According to the law of QM, $|\\alpha|^2$ and $|\\beta|^2$ represent the probability that we measure $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$. When we have multiple qubits, they will be in a state $|\\Psi\\rangle = |\\psi_1\\rangle \\otimes |\\psi_2\\rangle$ where $\\otimes$ is the tensor product. For the notation $|\\psi\\rangle$ it is called the bra-ket notation and is used everywhere in QM because it is very convenient. For simplicity, just see that $|\\rangle$, the ket is a column vector with the component of the state and $\\langle|$, the bra, is the transpose of the ket with complex conjugate taken on the components. We suggest you go check basic algebra with bra-ket notation. "

    "In QM when we do a measurement, the state 'collapses' in the state it is measured. The outcome of the measurement can be represented by a projector. For example if I have a state $|\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha|0\\rangle+\\beta|1\\rangle$, I can measure either $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$, this is represented by the set of projectors $\\{|0\\rangle\\langle0|,|1\\rangle\\langle1|\\}$, and the probability of each one is $P(i) = \\langle\\psi|P_i|\\psi\\rangle$, where $P_i$ is the corresponding projector."
